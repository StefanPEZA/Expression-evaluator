# Expression-evaluator
 Written in c++ with codeblocks and it uses the winbgim.h library. Make sure you have installed and configured winbgim for codeblocks before proceding to rebuild the source code! You can see a tutorial here on how to do it: https://www.edusoft.ro/introp/index.php/2018/11/23/biblioteca-grafica-winbgim/

You can transform an expresion from infix order to postfix,  then with this postfix expression you create an "Expression tree", from this you can get infix, postfix and prefix expression. Also with this tree you can evaluate/compute the expression with the function eval(Node* root)

To use the program just open the exe file located in bin/Debug or bin/Release.
